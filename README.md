# 🛍️ BazaarBay – E-commerce Product Page

Welcome to **BazaarBay**, a simple and clean **product page** of an e-commerce website developed as a learning task for **Saylani Mass IT Training (SMIT)**.

This project helped me understand how to fetch data from an API and dynamically display it using **JavaScript DOM manipulation**, while using **Bootstrap 5** and **Font Awesome** via CDN for styling.

---

## 📚 What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- ✅ **Fetch API** – Getting data from an external REST API.
- ✅ **Working with JSON** – Parsing and looping through API data.
- ✅ **JavaScript DOM Manipulation** – Creating and inserting HTML dynamically.
- ✅ **Bootstrap Grid System** – Responsive layout design.
- ✅ **CDN Integration** – Using Bootstrap & Font Awesome via CDN.
- ✅ **Responsive Card Design** – Styling product cards dynamically.
- ✅ **Cart Count Logic** – Simple counter with user interaction.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| HTML5 | Structure of the page |
| CSS3 | Custom styles |
| JavaScript | Fetching API data & interactivity |
| Bootstrap 5 (via CDN) | Responsive layout and components |
| Font Awesome (via CDN) | Icons (shopping cart, etc.) |
| [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) | Product data source |

---

## 📦 API Used

Data is fetched from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) using `fetch()`:
```javascript
fetch("https://fakestoreapi.com/products")
```

This API returns dummy product information (images, titles, descriptions, prices) which is dynamically displayed on the page using Bootstrap cards.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Make sure you have an internet connection (for Bootstrap & Font Awesome CDNs).
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Add category filters
- Add real cart functionality
